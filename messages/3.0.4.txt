Thanks for using the Gravity theme!

You may need to restart Sublime Text for it to display correctly. Also, if sidebar icons are missing,  disabling installed/inactive themes will typically fix it.

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions, or need to report any issues:

NEW FEATURE: "Sidebar Header"
Yup, I joined the band wagon and added a sidebar header.
To enable use:

    "gravity_sidebar_header": true


*************************************************************************

/!\ CHANGED THEME PREFERENCE NAMING.

Sorry for the inconvenience, but theme settings now preface with `gravity_`
to avoid conflicts with other contributed themes. The new settings are:

    "gravity_highlight_color_blue": true
    "gravity_tab_font_small": true
    "gravity_tab_height_short": true
    "gravity_tab_height_tall": true

*************************************************************************


How to enable:

To activate the theme for ST3, add or replace your current theme settings with the code below.

For Gravity Theme:

    "theme": "Gravity.sublime-theme",
    "color_scheme": "Packages/Theme - Gravity/Monokai Gravity (SL).tmTheme"


For Reverse Gravity Theme:

    "theme": "Reverse Gravity.sublime-theme",
    "color_scheme": "Packages/Theme - Gravity/Monokai Gravity (SL).tmTheme"


For Gravity One Theme:

    "theme": "Gravity One.sublime-theme"

Suggest using the "One Dark Sublime Text 3 Color Scheme" or "One Half Color Schemes" with Gravity One.

To increase the file tab height use:

    "gravity_tab_height_tall": true


To decrease the file tab height use:

    "gravity_tab_height_short": true


To decrease the file tab font size use:

    "gravity_tab_font_small": true


For blue highlight color option use:

    "gravity_highlight_color_blue": true
